This is a JS project that I started to get more comfortable with coding in JS. I used React as my framework and learned in details about states and react components. I also used React-Redux to manage the data flow instead of traversing in a tree. I used Material UI for my design.

This website focused on data management between the client and the server and I learned how to push and pull data from a database. I used Firebase to manage my database.
